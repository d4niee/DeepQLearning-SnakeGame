# üêç DeepQLearning-SnakeGame

**Source Code Coming Soon!**

This project implements an AI that learns the classic Snake game using Deep Q-Learning. It uses two different approaches: Fast-forward training and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based training. In fast-forward training, the agent learns by playing many games in a short time, while in CNN-based training, the agent learns the game by looking at images of the field. Both approaches use the Q-learning process to learn the optimal strategy. The project also includes a detailed visualisation of the learning process and the agent's performance.
